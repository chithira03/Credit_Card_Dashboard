# Credit Card Dashboard Using PowerBI
A Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends for credit card transactions. The project uses SQL for data storage, DAX for calculations, and Power BI for visualization

### The objective of this project is to develop an interactive and dynamic dashboard that enables businesses, analysts, and financial professionals to:
Monitor weekly financial trends in the credit card industry.
Analyze customer behavior based on age, income, and spending patterns.
Track revenue and transaction metrics for performance evaluation.
Compare current vs. previous periods to gain actionable insights.

### Dataset & Sources
The dataset consists of transaction data extracted from an SQL database. It includes:
Customer details (age, income, credit card type, etc.).
Transaction records (total transaction amount, frequency, and type).
Revenue metrics (annual fees, interest earned, and transaction charges).

### Credit Card Transaction Dashboard 
This focuses on key financial indicators such as total revenue, interest earned, transaction amount, and the number of transactions. It also categorizes transactions based on different types of credit cards, including Gold, Silver, Blue, and Platinum, to identify which category generates the highest revenue. Additionally, it presents revenue distribution by transaction methods, such as swipe, chip, and online payments, to highlight customer preferences. The dashboard further breaks down spending patterns across various expenditure types, including bills, entertainment, fuel, groceries, food, and travel, offering valuable insights into customer spending behavior.

### Credit Card Customer Dashboard 
provides an in-depth analysis of customer demographics and behavioral patterns. It categorizes customers based on their job roles, such as self-employed individuals, businessmen, government employees, blue-collar workers, white-collar professionals, and retirees. Education level insights, ranging from graduate and high school education to doctorate holders, further enhance the understanding of customer profiles. Another key feature of this dashboard is its ability to track revenue trends over time, segmented by gender, allowing for a more personalized approach to customer engagement. Additionally, the dashboard includes an analysis of car ownership to determine its impact on transaction volumes.

A crucial aspect of this dashboard is the Customer Satisfaction Score, which provides an indication of customer experience and loyalty. By incorporating this metric, businesses can assess customer engagement and identify areas for improvement.

The dashboard is designed for easy usability and interactive exploration. Users can filter data based on different time periods, card categories, and customer attributes to gain specific insights. The integration of Power BIâ€™s visualization capabilities makes it a powerful tool for financial and customer analytics.
